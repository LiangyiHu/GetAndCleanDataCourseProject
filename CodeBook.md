SubjectID comes from subject, ranges from 1 to 30.
Activity means which one of the six activities subject performed.

The rest of the variables are 66 out of original 561 variables based on criteria:
1. variable name contains string "-mean()"
2. variable name contains string "-std()"

Either one satisfies will be chose.

The data originally has 10299 observations, after aggregated with FUN=mean regarding 30 Subjects and 6 Activities, there are 180 left (product of 6 and 30)
